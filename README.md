# Job Sequencing and Tool Switching Problem
This repository provides an implementation of Catanzaro-Gouveia-Labbe formulation of job sequencing and tool switching problem (SSP) with uniform setup time. 
This formulation was introduced by [Catanzaro, Gouveia, Labbe (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2015.02.018). 

## Usage and Dependencies
* Codes are written in Julia using [JuMP framework](https://doi.org/10.1137/15M1020575).
* Solved with [Gurobi optimization solver](https://gurobi.com/) (under an academic license).
* Julia package 'DataStructures.jl' is used for dictionaries.
* Julia package 'Combinatorics.jl' is used for creating a powerset for subtour elimination constraints.
